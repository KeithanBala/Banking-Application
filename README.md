This application simulates an ATM/Online Banking Service that serves functions to the customer and the administrator. In this application, the customers can login to deposit and withdraw money, complete an online purchase, and check their account balance. On the admin side of the program, the admin can create customer profiles that include their login username, password, and their default tier in which they accumulate interest. On the administrator side of the application, you are also able to delete customer profiles. This project is finally encompassed in a sleek UI created using CSS, and the main functionality of the applicaion is coded using Java.
